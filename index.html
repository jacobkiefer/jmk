              Performed control system analysis, verification and validation support, and stability analysis. To address the time varying nature of the dynamics of a launch vehicle in flight, a stability evaluation technique for the nonlinear time varying launch vehicle dynamics is to incrementally adjust the gain and/or time delay in a time domain simulation until the system exhibits unstable behavior. This technique was implemented by using the Stability Aerospace Vehicle Analysis Tool to simulate the ascent trajectory with varying degrees of stability with an adaptive control algorithm active and inactive. The results show that the adaptive algorithm generally provides an additional 6 dB of gain margin at a small expense to phase margin.

              Landing on uprepared and uneven surfaces or a pitching and rolling ship represent some of the greatest challenges faced by rotorcraft today. Most rotorcraft have severely limited landing site options. Moreover, landings in complex terrain are performed very slowly. In the CAMM, we are investigating the use of robotic landing gear using both dynamic simulation and experimental laboratory testing. The use of robotic landing gear could enable revolutionary new operational capability for future rotorcraft.

              For example, hard landings can be mitigated using the rlg. The resulting impact of a hard landing can result in vehicle damage, structural failure, injuries, etc. The rlg softens the landing by acting as a shock absorber with a large stroke compared with a tradiation landing gear system. My reserach showed that the rlg can reduce peak loads during landing by up to 90% compared to a convential landing gear for multiple landing scenarios.  <a href="#rlg_paper"> See publication</a>

              A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to investigate factors affecting the synthesis of fluorescent polystyrene latex microspheres (PSLs) for use in wind tunnel measurement techniques such as PIV and LDV. PSLs have been used extensively as a seeding material, but additional capability is desired for the measurement of scalar properties of the flow. The ability to measure temperature simultaneously with velocity can provide a greater understanding of the flow physics. To this end, PSLs have been doped with a temperature dependant fluorescent dye. Statistical analysis was used with the DOE to gain insight about what effect different factors had on the particle synthesis process, as well as find the best configuration to produce PSLs of the correct size with a fluorescent dye incorporated well into the particles. <a href="#fdp_paper"> See publication</a>

              Although not identical to the motion employed by nature's swimmers and flyers, the simple harmonic oscillations of cantilever-like structures have been shown to provide efficient low-power solutions for applications ranging from thermal management to propulsion. However, in order to quantify their true potential, the resulting flow field and corresponding thrust must be better understood. To this end, a thin, flexible cantilever was actuated via a piezoelectric patch mounted near its base, causing vibration at the first resonance mode. The flow field was measured with particle image velocimetry while the thrust produced by the flow was quantified with a high-resolution scale. An oscillating Reynolds number was used to capture the trends in teh data and a clear relations ship between the operating parameters and resulting thrust was defined. Additionally, two-dimensional flow fields were extracted and used to motivate future geometry and sidwall configurations that could greatly enhance the thrust capabilities of the cantilever by directing the flow downstream in a more efficient manner. <a href="#cant_paper"> See publication</a>
